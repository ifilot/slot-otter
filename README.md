## Software

The main software component of this project is `OTTERNAV.EXE`, a DOS utility
used to navigate the FAT32-formatted SD card and copy files between the SD card
and the systemâ€™s hard drive. The program is compiled from source using Borland's
Turbo Assembler v2.0.1 and Turbo C v2.0, classic MS-DOS development tools
originally distributed by Borland Software Corporation. The binaries for these
tools were obtained from [WinWorldPC](https://winworldpc.com/home).
