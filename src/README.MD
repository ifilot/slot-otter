# Source code

This folder contains the source code to the interface program. This source code
has been developed using [Borland's Turbo Macro Assembler
2.01](https://winworldpc.com/download/501ac3a8-59c2-bdc3-a511-c3a4e280a613) and
[Borland's Turbo C compiler
2.01](https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-turbo-c/2x). Both programs need to
be installed and their binary folders need to be placed on the `$PATH`. To
compile the source code, simply head over to the directory containing the source
files and run `make`.
