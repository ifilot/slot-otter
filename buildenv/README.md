# Build Environment

This folder contains the binaries of Borland's Turbo Assembler v2.0.1 and
Borland's Turbo C compiler v2.0. The binaries were produced using the install
disks obtained from the following links
* https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-assembler/20
* https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-turbo-c/2x

**Disclaimer**: These binaries are provided here solely to reproduce a
historical build environment. To the best of my knowledge, Borland's Turbo
Assembler and Turbo C are no longer sold or supported and are generally regarded
as abandonware within the retro-computing community. However, they remain
proprietary software, and no explicit free-use licence has been issued by the
